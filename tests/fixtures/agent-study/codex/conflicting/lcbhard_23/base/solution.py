def count_event_ways(n: int, x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """ Calculate the number of ways an event can take place.
    
    An event is being held for n performers. When a performer arrives, they are assigned 
    to one of the x stages. All performers assigned to the same stage will perform together 
    as a band, though some stages might remain empty.
    
    After all performances are completed, the jury will award each band a score in the 
    range [1, y].
    
    Two events are considered different if either:
    - Any performer is assigned a different stage
    - Any band is awarded a different score
    
    Args:
        n: Number of performers (1 <= n <= 1000)
        x: Number of stages (1 <= x <= 1000)
        y: Maximum score that can be awarded (1 <= y <= 1000)
    
    Returns:
        The total number of possible ways the event can take place, modulo 10^9 + 7
