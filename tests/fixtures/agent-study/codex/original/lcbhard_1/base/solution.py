    """ Count the number of powerful integers in the range [start, finish].
    
    A positive integer x is called powerful if:
    1. It ends with s (s is a suffix of x)
    2. Each digit in x is at most limit
    
    Args:
        start: The start of the range (inclusive)
        finish: The end of the range (inclusive)
        limit: The maximum allowed digit value (1 <= limit <= 9)
        s: A string representing a positive integer that must be a suffix
    
    Returns:
        The count of powerful integers in the given range
