    """ 
    Given N development plans for a product with K parameters, find the minimum cost to raise
    all parameters to at least P. Each plan has a cost and increases parameters by specific amounts.
    Plans cannot be executed more than once.
    
    Args:
        n: Number of development plans (1 <= n <= 100)
        k: Number of parameters (1 <= k <= 5)
        p: Target value for all parameters (1 <= p <= 5)
        plans: List of tuples where each tuple contains:
               - cost: Cost of the plan (1 <= cost <= 10^9)
               - increases: List of K integers representing parameter increases (0 <= increase <= p)
    
    Returns:
        The minimum total cost to achieve the goal, or -1 if impossible.
