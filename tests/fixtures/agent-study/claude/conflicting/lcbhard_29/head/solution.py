def sum_manhattan_distances(m: int, n: int, k: int) -> int:
    """ Given a rectangular grid of size m × n, calculate the sum of Manhattan distances 
    between every pair of k identical pieces over all valid arrangements.
    
    A valid arrangement is a placement of all k pieces on the grid with at most one piece per cell.
    The Manhattan Distance between two cells (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) is |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|.
    
    Return the sum modulo 10^9 + 7.
    
    Args:
        m: Number of rows in the grid (1 <= m <= 10^5)
        n: Number of columns in the grid (1 <= n <= 10^5, 2 <= m * n <= 10^5)
        k: Number of identical pieces to place (2 <= k <= m * n)
    
    Returns:
        The sum of Manhattan distances between every pair of pieces over all valid arrangements,
        modulo 10^9 + 7.
