def min_operations_to_rearrange(n: int, s: str, t: str) -> int:
    """ Given two strings s and t of length n consisting of 'B' and 'W' characters,
    determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial configuration s
    into the target configuration t.
    
    Initially, there are n stones placed in cells 1 to n according to string s,
    where 'W' represents a white stone and 'B' represents a black stone.
    There are also two empty cells at positions n+1 and n+2.
    
    In one operation, you can:
    - Choose two adjacent cells that both contain stones
    - Move these two stones to the two empty cells while preserving their order
    
    Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve configuration t,
    or -1 if it's impossible.
    
    Args:
        n: Number of stones (2 <= n <= 14)
        s: Initial configuration string of length n
        t: Target configuration string of length n
    
    Returns:
        Minimum number of operations, or -1 if impossible
