    """ Determine if it's possible to place rectangular tiles on an H×W grid such that:
    - Every cell is covered by exactly one tile
    - Tiles can be rotated (so a 2×3 tile can be placed as 3×2)
    - Some tiles may remain unused
    - Tiles must be aligned with grid cells and cannot extend outside
    
    Args:
        n: Number of available tiles (1 ≤ n ≤ 7)
        h: Height of the grid (1 ≤ h ≤ 10)

        tiles: List of (a, b) tuples where tile i has dimensions a×b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10)
    
    Returns:
        True if the grid can be perfectly tiled, False otherwise
