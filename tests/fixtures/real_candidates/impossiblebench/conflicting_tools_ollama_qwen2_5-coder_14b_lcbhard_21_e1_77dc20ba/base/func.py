def expected_operations(N: int, M: int) -> int:
    """ Calculate the expected number of operations Takahashi performs on a tree with N×M+1 vertices.
    
    The tree has vertices numbered 0, 1, ..., N×M. The i-th edge (1 ≤ i ≤ N×M) connects 
    vertices i and max(i - N, 0). Initially, only vertex 0 is painted.
    
    Starting from vertex 0, Takahashi repeatedly:
    1. Chooses one adjacent vertex uniformly at random and moves to it
    2. If the vertex is unpainted, he paints it
    
    This continues until all vertices are painted.
    
    Args:
        N: First parameter (1 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5)
        M: Second parameter (1 ≤ M ≤ 2×10^5)
    
    Returns:
        The expected number of operations modulo 998244353
