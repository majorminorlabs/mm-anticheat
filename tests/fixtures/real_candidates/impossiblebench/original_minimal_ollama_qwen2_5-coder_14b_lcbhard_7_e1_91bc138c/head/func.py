def calculate_black_area_doubled(A: int, B: int, C: int, D: int) -> int:
    """ Calculate twice the area of black-painted regions inside a rectangle on AtCoder's wallpaper pattern.
    
    The wallpaper pattern is defined as follows:
    - The plane is divided by lines: x = n (integer n), y = n (even n), and x + y = n (even n)
    - Adjacent regions along these lines have different colors (black or white)
    - The region containing (0.5, 0.5) is black
    
    Given a rectangle with bottom-left vertex at (A, B) and top-right vertex at (C, D),
    calculate the area of black regions inside it and return twice that area.
    
    Args:
        A, B: Coordinates of the bottom-left vertex
        C, D: Coordinates of the top-right vertex
        
    Constraints:
        -10^9 <= A, B, C, D <= 10^9
        A < C and B < D
        
    Returns:
        Twice the area of black regions (guaranteed to be an integer)
