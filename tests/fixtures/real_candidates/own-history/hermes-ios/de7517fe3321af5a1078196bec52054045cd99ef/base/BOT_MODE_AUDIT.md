# Bot Mode mobile milestone — 2026-10-03

## Source and identity

Audited installed Hermes Agent commit: `4bb9e57bfde8a0affb5553eff13ed6e1f14147f1`
(`0.21.5+6627.g4bb9e57`), checkout `/Users/dippo/.hermes/hermes-agent`.
The running Desktop application is from that checkout's
`apps/desktop/release/mac-arm64/Hermes.app`. Its backend launch contract is
`hermes serve`, JSON-RPC over authenticated WebSocket, with REST for inventory
and persisted transcripts. The previously running mobile backend predated the
source update and did not implement `profiles.list`/`profiles.describe`.

Bot Mode is a **specialized profile layer plus Desktop presentation metadata**,
not a separate bot database. There is a first-class internal RPC contract that
was missing from the previous mobile audit. The bridge normalizes that contract;
Swift never reads host files or resolves profile paths.

| Field | Canonical source at the audited commit |
| --- | --- |
| Local roster and profile IDs | `tui_gateway/methods_profiles.py`, `profiles.list`; `hermes_cli/profiles.py::list_profiles`; live named-profile predicate in `hermes_constants.py::named_profile_is_live` |
| Name | `apps/desktop/src/plugins/hermes-bots/labels.ts::displayName`: server `profile.yaml` → `ui_meta['hermes-bots'].title`, then `display_name`, then Hermes for `default`, then formatted profile ID |
| Description | Bot Mode metadata description, then profile description; `profiles.describe` editor snapshot |
| Role | Backend permission role only when supplied; research/general categories are not inferred from names |
| Avatar | `profiles.list.has_avatar`, `profiles.get_asset {name,asset:'avatar'}` → bounded image data URL; absent shapes/local-only decorations retain a monogram |
| Last activity | `canonical_session` and `last_session`; Desktop helper `data.ts::botActivitySession` selects the fresher of those two; bridge also includes a more recent persisted worker session |
| Live working/idle | Not globally confirmed by this dedicated backend. V1 labels unobserved status or persisted last-active time instead of guessing Idle. Other Desktop processes' live event ownership remains incomplete |
| Canonical conversation | `(profile, title == 'Bot Chat')`; `methods_session.py::session.list {profile,title,include_hidden:true}` resolves by exact title, following the compression tip. No saved session ID or newest-chat fallback |
| Transcript | Profile-scoped REST `/api/sessions/{resolved_id}/messages`, normalized into the existing iOS Conversation/Message types |
| Model/provider, SOUL, skills, toolsets, MCP | `profiles.describe {name}` in `methods_profiles.py`; `config.yaml`, `SOUL.md`, installed `SKILL.md` indexes, `skills.disabled`, configured CLI toolsets, MCP names/enabled/transport |
| Routines | Profile-scoped REST `/api/cron/jobs`; name/enabled/timestamps/status metadata only |
| Memory | Profile-scoped REST `/api/memory`: active provider, provider metadata and allowlisted builtin byte counts; no contents or file paths |
| Agent plugins | Read-only `plugins.manage {profile,action:'list'}` from `methods_tools.py`; only name/enabled cross the mobile boundary |
| Config metadata | `profiles.describe.toolsets_pinned` and source attribution; no raw config, environment variables, provider keys, endpoint secrets, filesystem path APIs |

Desktop also retains window-local cosmetic/pinning/unread state in plugin storage
(`data.ts`, `profile-ops.ts::mergeServerMeta`). The mobile contract uses persisted
server metadata, not Electron local storage. Hidden bots (`hermes-bots.hidden`)
are omitted. Deleted/tombstoned/non-live profiles disappear with the next roster
read. Archiving a chat is different from hiding/deleting its bot; it does not
remove the profile. Hermes may repair accidentally archived canonical chats as
part of its own lookup; the bridge follows exact-title resolution and adds the audited initialization path below.

The default profile and the Hermes roster entry are the same identity. It is
included once in Bots, with no separate Default Profile section. Two distinct
profiles with the same display name remain distinct; names are not identity keys.

## Mobile API and authorization

- `GET /mobile/v1/bots`: freshly discovered roster, opaque IDs, source attribution,
  bounded activity metadata and canonical-chat availability.
- `GET /mobile/v1/bots/{id}`: fresh per-bot detail/configuration inventory.
- `GET /mobile/v1/bots/{id}/conversation`: resolve the canonical title on every
  request and return its current real transcript. Stable mobile routing ID
  `botchat.<bot-id>` identifies the relationship, not a pinned Hermes session ID. An existing mobile alias is reused when already bound to the same canonical transcript.
- `POST /mobile/v1/bots/{id}/conversation`: initialize if absent, then attach/resume and return the same normalized conversation/history envelope.
- Existing `/profiles`, conversation/run controls, authentication and profile
  allowlists remain compatible.
- `features.profiles` and `features.botMode` are separate. A backend advertises
  Bot Mode only after its RPC handshake verifies `bot_mode_protocol:true`.
  Older backends fall back to generic profiles. `features.botChat` additionally requires the explicit writable grant.

Opt in with `backends.<source>.bot_mode_roster: true` in the private bridge config,
or `install-bridge.sh --bot-mode` for a new installation. This explicitly grants
credentials that can read that backend's profile access to its **entire local
Desktop bot roster, including future bots**. It is a read-only roster grant;
existing generic profile control permissions are not broadened. An unconfigured
backend or one outside the credential allowlist cannot be selected through an
opaque bot ID. Do not opt a source into an audience that should see only one bot.

The production client uses the bot resources when Bot Mode exists. Simulation
fixtures remain isolated. Names in tests represent sanitized Studio fixtures;
production code does not contain the three Studio bot names.

## Refresh and chat behavior

Opening Bots starts a fresh fetch and a cancellable 15-second refresh while that
screen is visible. Pull to refresh, app foreground and successful reconnect also
refresh the roster. Each response replaces membership, so new profiles appear
and removed/hidden profiles disappear without rebuilding. Detail refreshes every
15 seconds while visible; roster refresh preserves loaded detail fields until a
fresh detail response replaces them. Refresh remains request-based; V1 does not
claim full Desktop change-event coverage.

Chat uses the normal ConversationView and composer. One tap initializes an absent
canonical chat or opens the existing one; a short opening state prevents duplicate
taps. Main Chat lists the same mobile conversation ID and bot identity. Rename and
delete are unavailable for canonical chats; changing their title would break identity.
Hidden/removed bots disappear from lists; opening their old resource fails safely,
while stored history and mobile run records are retained.

## Canonical initialization, execution and persistence

Desktop source: `apps/desktop/src/plugins/hermes-bots/canonical-chat.ts`,
`findExisting` (around line 271) and `openCanonicalBotChat` initialization (around
line 453). On an ordinary bot click, exact native-profile/title lookup precedes
creation. The bridge uses `session.create {profile,title:"Bot Chat",hidden:true,
follow_profile_config:true,close_on_disconnect:false,idempotency_key:<stable bot key>}`,
then `session.title` to persist the empty hidden row eagerly. It sends no intro
or model prompt. A title conflict adopts a freshly confirmed winner and closes
only the bridge's unused candidate. The source's unique title index is the
cross-process persistent duplicate guard. Lookup failure, inconsistent positive
roster identity, or unconfirmed title persistence fails closed without a default
profile fallback. Bridge locks serialize opens; a stable source create key also
protects retries after a lost reply.

`session.list` returns lineage root `id` and compression tip `resolved_id`.
Fresh roster root and indexed lookup must agree. Resume/history use the current
tip and exact native `profile`, while the mobile relationship ID stays stable.
The existing mobile conversation, run, stream/replay and stop/steer resources
are reused. Native `prompt.submit` receives the resumed runtime handle and bot
profile. Hermes's profile runtime binds model/provider, SOUL, skills, toolsets
and MCP; `follow_profile_config` survives resume and tracks native defaults.
Mobile does not supply a generic model override or copy personality into prompts.
User/assistant history belongs to the profile's Hermes database, not a parallel
mobile chat store. The bridge journal stores aliases, run projections and replay.
GET binds observed aliases locally but does not create/resume an upstream chat.

Source anchors: `tui_gateway/methods_session.py` create around 352, exact lookup
540, resume context 644, live attach 875; `methods_prompt.py` submit around 657;
`hermes_state_schema.py` unique title index around 134. The installed lazy live
resume payload (`server.py::_fallback_session_info`, around 3081) omits
`profile_name`: only that explicit `lazy:true` omission is accepted after exact
profile-scoped resolution. A reported profile mismatch is always rejected.

Resume attaches another transport alongside existing clients. `owned` means a
bridge-attached handle, not exclusive Desktop ownership. Native prompt submission
claims an engine process/session writer lease; it is not per-client exclusivity.
The bridge rejects a busy native session before allocating a new run and controls
only its own recorded runs, revalidating canonical identity and native handle.
Cross-process lease refusal or a lost send reply is surfaced, never retried as a
fresh message automatically. Independent Desktop clients may still share a
session; mobile does not claim universal observation/control of their runs.

Modern clarification (`server_requests.py`, `contracts/server_requests.py`) is an
ID-bearing JSON-RPC server request, not the older notification/`clarify.respond`
protocol. The bridge opts into `client.capabilities`, stores exact request/qids,
replays `open_requests` snapshots after reconnect, handles cancellation and
answers via `clarify.lock`. Mobile answers are serialized per attention item;
accepted Desktop answers in a fresh snapshot are rejected as stale. Hermes can
still permit competing clients to overwrite a qid before a batch completes, so
this is not an atomic cross-client answer lease. Unsupported approval/secret/sudo
requests receive `-32601`; no approval or empty credential is invented. True
window requests receive `4404` only with negotiated `declines_not_shown`, allowing
shown Desktop peers to answer. Socket-reader handlers never wait on their own RPC.

For new installs, `install-bridge.sh --bot-chat` enables both roster and canonical
chat access. Existing installs explicitly set `backends.<source>.bot_chat_control:
true` alongside `bot_mode_roster:true`, then use the guarded updater. It grants
`chat.control` credentials access to every visible local bot including future
bots; opaque bot IDs do not introduce per-bot authorization. Read-only roster
access remains available without the writable grant.

## Later create/edit work

Desktop's underlying mechanism is available but intentionally not exposed here:
`profiles.create`, `profiles.configure` (SOUL/description/model/provider,
disabled_skills/enabled_toolsets/enabled_mcp_servers), `profiles.set_asset`, and
profile delete/rename operations. Bot creation also needs Desktop's adopt-before-
minting exact-title chat flow, hidden initialization and intro behavior. Editing
requires safe handling of `applied` partial successes, model-cost confirmation,
and `ui_meta_expected_revisions` compare-and-swap. Delete/archive must distinguish
profile deletion from hidden roster metadata and chat archival, protect active
turns and preserve history intentionally. Canonical Bot Chat delivery is now implemented with the shared-client limits
described above. Bot creation/configuration remains deferred.

## Verification and Studio/device evidence

See `BOT_MODE_VALIDATION.md` for completed results, discovered Studio identities,
physical-device evidence and remaining limits. Source investigation and fixtures
must be distinguished from actual physical-phone validation.
