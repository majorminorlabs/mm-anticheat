# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — release candidate (2026-10-04)

### Native Hermes chat

Persistent conversations, canonical history, streamed replies, grouped tool
activity, live status, stop/steer and explicit supported retry. Reconnect uses
retained events plus canonical snapshots, without automatically replaying commands.

### Bot Mode

Dynamic native bot discovery and shared canonical writable chats. Create, edit,
duplicate and hide use Hermes's profile lifecycle. Supported configuration includes
name/description, SOUL, host-provided model/provider, skills, toolsets and MCP
selection. Hide preserves conversation/history; hard delete is unavailable.

### Tasks and status

Current run/host status, routine and cron management, configured Kanban boards,
worker/task metadata, usage and capability-gated inventories.

### Attachments and voice

Files, selected Photos and new Camera captures, composer previews and safe upload
IDs scoped to a conversation. Up to four attachments, 10 MiB each. Native partial
speech recognition populates editable text; dictation uploads no audio to Hermes.

### Talaria design

Talaria display name and winged-sandal icon, light/dark appearance, Desktop bot
faces, readable error summaries and compact tool history. Markdown tables retain
a normal Grid and use stacked heading/value rows at accessibility sizes, avoiding
the confirmed SwiftUI layout freeze.

### Networking and security

Private Tailscale HTTPS, authenticated scoped/revocable mobile tokens, device-only
Keychain storage, owner-only Studio state and guarded per-user launchd services.
Secrets, private host configuration and personal signing are excluded from releases.
Research Terminal search works with PostgreSQL when configured on the host.

### Known limitations

No App Store distribution or APNs push delivery. Private tailnet connectivity and
an awake/logged-in host are required. Remote dangerous approvals, standalone skill
installation and some settings/integrations are unavailable. Host versions are
audited explicitly; independent Desktop clients can take over native live event
ownership. Apple network speech recognition is used when on-device recognition is
unavailable. Free signing expires after seven days; SideStore update-in-place and
Keychain preservation remain a separate physical acceptance gate.
