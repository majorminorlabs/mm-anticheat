# Talaria

Talaria is a native iPhone companion for Hermes running on your Mac. Hermes runs
the agents and keeps their records; Talaria provides chat, bots, tasks and status
through a private authenticated bridge.

**v0.1.0 is an early personal-install release candidate.** It is not available on the App
Store. The bundle identifier remains `com.dippo.hermes` to preserve updates.

## What works

- Persistent conversations, streaming replies, tool/activity history, stop and steer.
- Hermes Bot Mode: dynamic discovery, canonical writable bot chats, create/edit,
  duplicate and hide. Native Hermes profiles remain the source of truth.
- Tasks, routines, configured Kanban boards, usage and current run status.
- Files, Photo Library and new Camera captures with attachment previews.
- Native speech-to-text into the editable composer; microphone audio stays out
  of the Hermes bridge.
- Reconnect/replay, foreground reconciliation and cached last-known state offline.
- Research Terminal retrieval/search when the host skill and credentials are configured.
- Talaria branding, light/dark appearances and accessible Markdown tables.

Features are capability-gated by the host. Dangerous tool approvals remain
Studio-only because the audited Hermes protocol cannot safely target them.

## Requirements

- macOS host with Python 3.11+ and an existing, prepared Hermes installation.
- Full Bot Mode/media support was tested against Hermes commit
  `4bb9e57bfde8a0affb5553eff13ed6e1f14147f1`. The bridge also supports the audited
  legacy `2a4c9afd7bd` contract with fewer capabilities; arbitrary newer versions
  are not automatically trusted.
- Tailscale on Mac and iPhone, MagicDNS/HTTPS and an access policy permitting
  the phone to reach the host on TCP 443. Serve stays private; Funnel is unused.
- iOS 18+, Xcode 26+ for development, and your own Apple signing identity for
  personal installation. SideStore can re-sign the unsigned IPA.

## Install

Start with [installation](docs/INSTALL.md). It covers the existing Hermes
requirement, bridge setup, HTTPS, private token creation and host pairing.
[Studio setup](docs/STUDIO_SETUP.md) covers service ownership, restart and backup;
[personal signing / SideStore](docs/SIDESTORE.md) covers device installation,
refresh and the outstanding SideStore update test.

For the full tested host feature set, a fresh bridge installation uses:

```sh
git clone <repository-url> talaria
cd talaria
./scripts/install-bridge.sh --bot-management --bot-chat --bot-mode --board default
./scripts/configure-tailscale.sh
./scripts/status-bridge.sh
./scripts/pairing-token.sh --name iPhone
```

Enter the URL printed by the HTTPS setup helper and the privately displayed
mobile token in **Talaria → More → Hosts → Add Host**. Tokens are device-only
Keychain items. Hermes/provider/Research Terminal credentials stay on the Mac.
The installer does not install Hermes or replace existing gateways.

## Develop and test

Open `Hermes.xcodeproj`, select the **Hermes** scheme and an iPhone simulator.
The Xcode project/targets retain technical Hermes names. Normal launch uses the
Studio bridge; explicit Simulation mode and test fixtures are separate.

```sh
xcodebuild -project Hermes.xcodeproj -scheme Hermes \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -parallel-testing-enabled NO test
cd hermes-mobile-bridge
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Personal signing belongs in ignored `Signing.local.xcconfig`; copy
`Config/Signing.example.xcconfig` and set your Team locally. The current shared build configuration and release artifacts contain no personal
Team, certificate or provisioning material. Historical Git metadata still needs
privacy cleanup before public push; see [release readiness](docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md).

No APNs delivery or guaranteed execution while iOS suspends the app. The Mac must
be awake, logged in and reachable on the tailnet. Some inventories/settings remain
unavailable, and independent native clients can conflict with live transport
ownership. Free Personal Team provisioning expires after seven days. SideStore
update/data preservation must be verified separately from successful Xcode updates.
